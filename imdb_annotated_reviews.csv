1,"Denis Villeneuve has accomplished what was considered impossible for decades, to write and direct a faithful adaptation to the fantastic 1965 sci-fi novel by Frank Herbert. And I'm here to tell you, he has done it, he has actually done it.I was introduced to the world of dune in 1992 by playing the video game DUNE released that year. The story completely captivated me, so i decided to read the book. And to this day, it's one of the best stories I've ever read. A tale absolutely grand in scale, and filled with details, making it really hard to adapt for the big screen, even today with all the technology we have at our disposal.I saw the film made by David Lynch, a few years after i read the book, and about 10 years after it was released, and i didn't enjoy it much. The 1984 film completely fails at capturing the very essence of the novel, and feels shallow and unfocused.One of the main differences with this movie and the 1984 movie, is that Villeneuve has only centered on the first half of the first novel. And with over two and a half hours runtime, he is able to concentrate more on the small details, than Lynch ever could. But on the flip side, this also means that this movie has no conclusion.From reading the book, i know what comes next, i know how this story ends. But a lot of people watching this movie, especially those who haven't read the book, can obviously feel like they were watching a prologue to something great, that never happens. This is a very risky move by both Villeneuve and the production companies, because this can only work if part 2 is released to conclude the story. It's kind of how they did it with ""the lord of the rings"" trilogy.But, still, without a conclusion, what a massive blast of a movie this is. I've seen it in IMAX twice already, and the grand scale of everything, the sandworms, the space ships, the ornithopters, the buildings, the sound effects, the soundtrack, the locations. It's epic in every meaning of the word. And all of this without losing track of the deep relationships between the characters. This is a movie that manages to perfectly blend massive awesomeness with true heartfelt emotions.The actors are near perfectly cast, all carrying their roles really well, although i felt some of them didn't get enough screen time.This movie does follow the book quite closely, but some things has been changed and/or left out to fit in a movie format, i must admit that during my second IMAX viewing, i felt that Villeneuve maybe should have adapted this as a mini series instead. But that would have dramatically changed the grand scale of everything, but on the other hand, he could've dived deeper into the lore. Two and a half hours to adapt half of the first novel, is cutting it real tight. And with all the stuff you are constantly being fed throughout this movie, it can become somewhat difficult to follow and understand it all.But that being said, I had really high hopes for this film, i was one of those people hyped beyond belief. I've been waiting for this movie for about 30 years. And still, most of this movie is either as i imagined it myself, or better.What Denis Villeneuve has accomplished here, is actually quite astonishing, he has actually made DUNE. It's finally here, it's gigantic, and close to everything i asked for.The only big drawback, is as i mentioned, that this movie has no conclusion, it's two and a half hours of build-up to something great, that never happens, but it's still a huge epic packed with an awesome soundtrack, solid acting, fantastic CGI and sound effects and jaw dropping locations captured with brilliant cinematography. It's most definitively made for the big screen, absolutely no doubt about that.Denis Villeneuve has once again shown us he's a force to be reckoned with, a brilliant filmmaker, and one of the best of his generation, even one of the best of all time.I give this movie a 9 out of 10. We need part 2, we need it badly. This story deserves to be concluded. But if it never comes, i will just imagine the last half of the first novel with this movie as the template.",positive
2,"It's been amazing being back in cinemas after last year, I have seen some good films, and some shockers, this though, is the first great film of the year for me.The story is somehow easier to follow than in the last adaptation, motives and actions are easier to see and follow. I felt as though the book had come to life here, even if there are a couple of changes.The acting is impressive, as is the music, the visuals however are the most incredible thing about this film, it looks awe inspiring. The battles are epic, the staging is impressive, you almost feel close to the action, I cannot praise that element highly enough.When I saw Part one, I was a little surprised, I was a little more surprised by the ending, I only hope the wait isn't too long.Pacing, considering where the film ends, it never felt slow or drawn out, I was captivated from start to finish.Truly, I was blown away, 10/10.",positive
3,"It's been some time since I've read the Frank Herbert novel, and I had already forgotten much of the story. However it wasn't a problem picking things up as characters and situations presented themselves in this film, so I'd have to say that was a plus for this viewer. The scope of this picture is quite outstanding, spanning as it does a complex and fragmented universe of worlds and kingdoms. Central to the story is the valued importance placed on a spice that's a preferred hallucinogenic for some, and for the elite, an important component required for interstellar travel. In the novel I believe it was something as common as cinnamon, but on the planet Arrakis, required an intensive mining operation to reclaim it from the barren desert soil in which it's found.The entire story is veiled with a mystical sort of ambiance in which the protagonist, Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), learns of his destiny while obliquely being referred to as 'The One' of legend, a person who will come into great power. Quite honestly, the setting, costuming, characterizations and palace intrigue is all quite reminiscent of 'Star Wars', even if the original novel was written over a decade before George Lucas arrived on the scene. Even the hostile environment of Arrakis has the feel of Tatooine, with the appearance of the Shai-Hulud recalling the Sarlacc, one of Jabba the Hutt's favorite pets.What surprised me with this first installment of the Dune saga was how well director Denis Villeneuve managed to condense the epic scope of a massive novel onto film, even if half of the story is yet to be told. The movie incorporates the most critical elements of the novel into a narrative that works really well. Even though I actually did enjoy the 1984 version directed by David Lynch, this one proves to be more inclusive of events in the novel, and I look forward to a successful conclusion to the saga in due time.",positive
4,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Dune. Part I"" (2021) was amazing cinematic experience. This is a movie that demands to be seen on a big screen, no less. I haven't read a book nor seen previous version of it, therefore all things that i saw story wise were fresh for me. And i won't lie i did felt to be lost here and there, but at the end of the day the storyline was clear.The visual side of this movie was staggering. This is a 100% movie going experience. Special effects looked as real as it gets - if you enjoyed visual side of ""Blade Runner 2049"" you will get same here - grandiose sets, design, sound and all technical stuff - this movie at every scene looked breathtaking. Yet i wished cinematography was done by Roger Deakins, but still it was solid (but could been even better). Acting was very good by all involved - you can't ask for more from such a cast.Overall, few reasons why i did not gave it 10/10 is because it did felt like a set up of a story more then once - way more then once. Also there are some pacing issues here and there. And finally, this movie will loose ~80% of its visual side when watched at home in my opinion, this is a real movie going experience. But at the end i liked it very much and would like to see Part II - fingers crossed!",positive
5,"Having read the book a hundred years ago, it took some time to begin to understand what was going on. If there is a criticism that many share, it is the pacing of the first part of the film. It needed something to set the scene for us, to show us who the strong and the weak were. I'm not much for narration (show me, don't tell me), but it may not have been a bad idea. The scenes are magnificent with special effects off the chart. Many desert travel scenes are quite endless. How do you spruce up a desert. I thought the sand worms were a little one dimensional. I know there is another film down the road.",positive
6,"Denis Villeneuve directs this remake of the Frank Herbert classic sci-fi. It's the first part of two movies. Timothée Chalamet is the lead as Paul Atreides. The emperor has given his family the desert planet Arrakis where the most important spice is mined. It's a trap and everyone knows it.I've never read the book. I have seen the David Lynch version and the Sci Fi movies. I do miss some of the Lynchian weirdness. This version feels more Earth-bound without the weirdness. Arrakis has a lot more middle eastern influences. House Atreides is more Scottish. I do wish that they get rid of the damn bagpipes. One hopes that they would get rid of that noise in a few thousand years. As for Chalamet, he is the perfect prettiness for the role. He looks too pretty to be believed as a fighter which is exactly what every other character comments on about him. He has the ethereal look of an angelic hero in an ancient classical Greek story. I'm not sure if newbies could get lost in this labyrinthian world. It's not really that complicated. I think Villeneuve has made the right movie. He puts his skills into the epic feel of this franchise. It feels right... coming from a non-book-reader.",positive
7,"When David Lynch unleashed his interpretation of Frank Herberts largely unfilmable political science fiction opus, many critics panned it as too condensed and disjointed.Fast forward to 2021 and another filmmaker takes a stab at Dune. There are many things Denis Villeneuve does well here, but again missing much of Herberts tone. In the end I feel Mr. Lynch had a better idea of what to cut out and what to leave in than Villeneuve did.You cannot have a adaptation of Dune without the politics, without the religion, without the internal monologues...even the crappy Syfy channel miniseries got that right.Now where this film does shine is in the visuals and costumes.departments as well as art direction. There is plenty to see and gawk over here.The casting is good. Timothy Chalamet is probably closer to the novel's description of Paul Atreides although Kyle MacLachlan captured the characters spirit and demeanor better. I'm a fan of Josh Brolin but I feel he is miscast here as Gurney. Patrick Stewart nailed it. The rest are good.I'm not too happy with the Baron's diminished role. And also the pronunciations of house names and titles are more like SyFy channel and less like Lynch. I prefer Lynch.It is definitely worth a watch or two. I look forward to seeing how it will be wrapped up in part two. But David Lynch's Dune will never be equaled, unless someday Jodorowsky gets to make his.",positive
8,"Although the film is called 'Dune', the opening title refers to it as 'Dune Part One'. I knew, when I saw this, it probably should have been better to wait for Part Two before watching it. As a result some characters felt underdeveloped, and some simply vanished halfway through the movie. They also kept talking about Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet) being 'The One', but the one for what? This somehow reminded me of Neo from 'The Matrix', also being 'The One'.Regardless, 'Dune' is a spectacle of note. From the stunning visuals, state of the art CGI, production design, and cinematography, to good performances from a stellar cast and a great score, this is one amazing movie. Sure, the film won't satisfy everyone's palate, and if you're not a sci-fi/fantasy fan, 'Dune' will not appeal to you. However, one can't help but be impressed by what they've accomplished.Ok, now, you can crucify me if you want, but for me there were some issues with the film. With the movie being so long, I later found myself thinking there's a hell of a lot going on, with very little happening. Maybe this is because this is not a completed movie (being Part One), but I didn't always understand the character motives, and I still don't really understand what Paul's real mission is. Spice is the most valuable substance in the universe, and I understand Paul follows in his Father's footsteps to preserve the spice production, but he is always on the move and I don't follow whereto. It sometimes also felt like they were holding back on the action sequences. Some of the action scenes ended so abruptly...Also, large parts of the movie reminded me of other films, like 'Tremors', 'The Chronicles of Riddick', and 'Star Wars'. Then a number of credibility issues. The film is set in 10191, but there were medieval elements here as well. Will they still be using scrolls so far into the future to read messages from? Will they still read books? Will they address leaders as ""My Lord""? This, and their costumes, felt very dated.If the film was about 30 minutes shorter, it would have been much better paced, with all the unnecessary scenes on the cutting room floor. It was just too long to keep me entertained for the entire 155 minutes, no matter how astonishing the production values.Ok, now that I've had my rant, 'Dune' is still an incredibly well made film, and worth watching at least once.",positive
9,"I have seen many reviewers write that this movies has no ending. That's true. BUT: The ending Denis chose seems perfect to me. There is no cliffhanger, no big question that I needed immediate answers to. This movie is about house Atreides being betrayed and the path this sets Paul on. This path leads him to his new home: Arrakis.In that sense, this movie had enough of an ending for me to not feel dissatisfied.That said, I will probably go and read the book instead of waiting 3 years (or forever) for the conclusion of this story arc.This is a movie of gigantic scale that feels so familiar, yet so fresh and and unique in it's own way. It's a 2.5 hour, polished piece of art and spectacle.I cannot recommend it more, and if you're hesitant because it's just part 1, don't be.I would give this an easy 9.5/10.",positive
10,"Dune (2021): Not at all as retro as Lynch's Dune, the Flash Gordon/Steampunk aesthetic is replaced by starker yet still ancient looking furnishings and the Spaceships are more modern than mondo. Still though, there's something of the Imperial Stormtroopers about some of the soldiers, even those out of armour tend to look like Star Wars ship crews. But this is a far darker tale than any SW chicanery. We see Paul Atriedes (Timothée Chalamet) visiting his grandfathers grave who died fighting a bull, Galician Bagpipes are played as the Atriedes family walk along the exit ramp of a spaceship. The spaceships are impressive, a submerged troop/suppies rising up like a whale. But these ships are are like grains of sand compared to the vast Starships, ornithopters are extensively used for transport and combat on Arrakis. The betrayal and retaking of Arrakis by the Harkonnens is vividly portrayed in attacks from above, hand to hand fighting bombings. Here Duncan Idaho(Jason Momos) is given more room to develop as a character than in the 1984 film, it's yet to be seen if Josh Brolin's Gurney Halleck will match or outdo hat of Patrick Stewart's portrayal. The true role of the Bene Gesserit and the early appreciation by the Fremen of Paul as a potential Prophet/Savior is more subtly related by Villeneuve. This is just Part One, i eagerly await the second half. Directed/Co-Written by Denis Villeneuve. 9/10.",positive
11,"More so than even 'Lord of the Rings', Frank Herbert's 'Dune' is an extremely difficult story to translate to film. All of the novel's many, many moving parts require the kind of explanation that just isn't possible in the format. Therefore you have to find a kind of cinematic shorthand the way David Lynch did with his polarizing 1984 adaptation. Or else you go w/a mini-series, which allows for a greater runtime ala the SyFy network's 2000 attempt. Here the solution was to cut the novel essentially in half. Unfortunately that creates an entirely different problem. Half a story simply isn't satisfying.The film itself is handsomely shot and the f/x are strong, though I dare say the design work is rather bland. The score by Hans Zimmer is an oppressive yet forgettable kit-bash of the ""exotic"" white noise that litters so many fantasy and sci-fi films in the 21st century. The characters are under-cooked, but the actors themselves are by and large solid.As someone who has read the novel three times I have a difficult time deciding if the uninitiated will have even an inkling of what's going on. But even if they do, I can't imagine that what we get here will ultimately be satisfying in a substantive way.",positive
12,"To be honest I wasn't expecting it to be a first episode in the series of films, so that was a disappointment at first - but then I realised it's just impossible to put whole book in one movie in any meaningful way (with all my love to the Lynch's version, it didn't do the book much justice), so splitting the story into several parts is actually a good decision.Problem is, even with this division the film doesn't really provide much of the background details on who all the characters are, what's the state of the world, why spice is actually important to the navigators, who are the navigators and many many different important well-thought aspects that make the book so great. Instead there are long scenes focused on the main character, surroundings, futuristic machinery and so on.There are two more outcomes of such screen usage:
1. It all looks absolutely gorgeous and amazingly well designed - ""firefly"" fighters are incredible, harvesters and their delivery is awesome, and many other things are equally stunning. And oh, the costumes! The costumes are the best.2. Major actors playing secondary characters don't get much time at all - they're all playing their roles very well, but we barely see them at all (save perhaps Jason Momoa, but even his screen time is scarce).Overall it's a great cinematographic feat, and the best Dune adaptation so far - but we'll have to wait the rest of it to see if it holds true. I only wish they'd put more world-building details into the narrative...",positive
13,"I can't say I'm disappointed with Dune, given the track record of director Denis Villeneuve. In the past, he has stooped to artsy garbage (Enemy), weak adaptations (Arrival, which avoids exactly those elements that made its source an unsettling classic), and hollow spectacle (Blade Runner 2049, an endless, empty, at times ludicrous mess).That said, I didn't hate Dune. I simply found it lackluster.The good: the visuals are splendid. The music is nice, though not exactly memorable. The narrative sticks wisely close to the book.The not so good: first of all, the casting. Not one of the actors in this film really blows me away. Paul Atreides, in particular, is far too weak to hold our attention. Not terrible, but at the same time not capable of suggesting the hidden strength that will soon make him a leader of men, a 'mahdi.' Jessica does a nice job with what she's got, but the script leaves her little to do but whimper, without suggesting the deep well of authority the character should have. The Duke Leto probably fares best, though again I think he's portrayed as a rather weak character, not the iron duke of the book.The worst: the pacing. I didn't find the slow, deliberate pace to be annoying. However, Dune the book is actually both dense and fast-paced. By taking the slow road, Villeneuve leaves no room for the background and character depth that's really needed for a proper epic. Grand vistas are not what make films like Lawrence of Arabia great - it's the deep, powerful storytelling. Even if Villeneuve was allowed to stretch this franchise to three films, it would be too late to fill in the missing detail in this first installment.I hate to think what anyone unfamiliar with Dune, the book, will make of this eye-candy adaptation. Probably, they'll wonder why anyone would bother adapting such a lethargic and superficial book. Dune the movie comes across as a Cliff's Notes version of the book: faithful, yet without any of the juice that make the book so compelling. See it if you have a spare evening, but don't feel there's any urgency about it.",positive
14,"I feel I should start by saying I have minimal context for this film. I've never read the book(s?) and I don't really remember the '84 movie all that well. So I'm going into this fairly fresh and with no real explanations. That said...With all due respect to the brilliant Mr. Villeneuve, this felt like a massive superficial film that is a technical marvel but feels so hollow. Seriously, this thing is GORGEOUS with a capital everything, the sound is spectacular, it's shot beautifully but there just doesn't feel like enough meat beneath all the flash. It is a masterpiece on paper, with performances to match the visuals but after two and a half hours I felt like I was struggling to stay awake through an overlong prologue to an actual story.Yeah, this is going to be multiple movies (assuming they get the green light for another) and it feels like it. Kinda how Fellowship of the Ring felt like a dull venture in walking until the ensuing films added texture to the franchise. Maybe when Dune 2 comes out this one will feel like a more cohesive piece but for now it lacks a soul to match all of the stunning visuals.I'm hitting this one hard when I do think there were some legitimately great things here, it just all felt vacuous and empty and I wanted more of an actual story. Still think it's worth checking out, just for the technical mastery and stunning presentation but... That's about all that's here.",positive
15,"I just returned from a screening, and WOW! It's visually stunning, the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is majestic, the acting is spot on! The pacing might seem a little slow by todays standards, but it never gets boring. And I actually find it really refreshing to see serious SciFi for adults, without bangs or a ""comic relief"" every other second.I've read the book about four or five times more than 20 years ago. And from my memory (I will refresh it soon) the movie stays true to the story of the book and, more importantly, its general feeling.Opposed to many other people, I also quite liked David Lynchs interpretation, despite all of its shortcomings. Because one thing that Lynch got right, was the ""psychedelic"" nature of the book.And that's my only gripe with Denis Villeneuves adaptation, and the reason why I don't give it 10 stars: While he hints at the mindaltering properties of spice, he never explores the psychedelic aspects of the book as deep as I'd like them to be explored.Here's my hope for part two. If he creates a second part, and manages to keep up the quality while at the same time not shying away from the psychedelic underpinnings of the source material. He will have created a two part masterpiece.",positive
16,"Dune: Part One (2021) is a movie the wife and I saw in theatres at an advanced screening. The storyline tells the tale of an emperor who changes leadership in his most important and profitable planet in his kingdom. Follow the new family as they move in and adjust to a ruthless landscape filled with people who don't want to help them and resources set up for them to fail. They quickly realize they may have bit off more than they can chew on several fronts. This movie is directed by Denis Villeneuve (Blade Runner 2049) and stars Timothée Chalamet (Little Women), Rebecca Ferguson (Doctor Sleep), Zendaya (Spider-Man), Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker), Jason Mamoa (Aquaman), Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men). The storyline for this is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece in a Star Wars mixed with Game of Thrones kind of way. The vastness and complexity is outstanding and how all the pieces fit together is remarkable. The cast is brilliantly selected and the special effects and action scenes are breathtaking. A few scenes were shot darker than I would have liked but not enough to not call this film perfection. The action scenes are well choreographed and the fierceness of the war and fight sequences were awesome. There is a level of uncertainty in every second of the film. This is a rare masterpiece in a Lord of the Rings/Star Wars kind of way that happens once every 20-30 years that is an absolutely must see. This is an all-time great science fiction movie that is an easy 10/10.",positive
17,"Just watched one of the first screenings of 'Dune' at an IMAX cinema and damn, that were some of the best two and half hours of my life. I was hyped for this movie from the moment it was announced since I'm a huge fan of Denis Villeneuve - but also because the story really spoke to me in a special sense. I haven't read the books, so this experience was very original and new for me.I was amazed when I heard about the amazing cast that was going to be in this film. When I saw them in action I was even more amazed, overwhelmed even. Every one of these top-tier actors brought their A-game to the set of 'Dune' and this makes the characters so much more interesting. The person the amazed me the most was Rebecca Ferguson. Her portrayal of Lady Jessica was absolutely outstanding.The visuals and cinematography in this movie were out of this world. You'd almost think that they actually filmed on different planets. You could pause the movie at any point in time and you would always be looking at a beautiful painting of its own. The sets were incredible, so were the special effects. You can really tell people worked hard on this.Hans Zimmer's score was pristine (as always). It really brought the universe of 'Dune' to life by creating a unique atmosphere of its own. The sound design was also incredible. I was a big fan of the loud, obscure sounds that were coming from many of the gigantic ships. It really gave you and idea of how large in scale this story is.As far as the story goes, I don't know if I can give a good opinion. I haven't read the books nor watched the previous adaptions, so I don't know if this adaption stayed true to the original. All I can say is that this story really pulled me in from the get go and didn't let go until a few hours after the movie ended. And I'm still not over it. I rate this movie 9/10 because I absolutely adore it, missing the one point because the ending didn't really feel like an ending. I truly hope part two gets made because this story deserves to be completed.",positive
18,"I remember seeing a book in my home, as a child. I had no idea what it was but the cover art, of a desert tribesman with piercing blue eyes affected me. Even scared me. The image stayed with me.Everyone that has read Frank Herbert's Dune will have their own vision of it. That's the magic of the written word. And if Frank Herbert taught us anything, it was to have an open mind.Villeneuve has shown us, with Dune, that dreams can be given justice, if the heart is in the right place.A grand achievement of cinema and of science fiction. Many will wish that Herbert was still around to have seen this. But of course he already has.Salut.",positive
19,"From the director of ""Arrival"" and ""Blade Runner 2049"", comes another sci-fi epic ""DUNE: Part One"" based on the novel.It's the year of 10191. There are different planets with different species of human. Our main character Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is the future of House Atreides. He is on an adventure to Arrakis, a beautiful planet that produces spies and full of dangerous sandworms.This is all I can say without spoilers. The thing about DUNE is it's stunning direction and breathtaking cinematography (by Greig Fraser) and visual image. Not to mention the amusing score (by Hans Zimmer).I watched DUNE in IMAX. Frequent shots of enormous spaceships and battle sequences are always a pleasure throughout. The making of this movie should be rightfully appreciated.It's a movie forcing the audience to pay attention, in a good way. The plot takes time to digest but once you know what's going on, it's a lot of fun.A lot of characters are introduced. Gurney (Josh Brolin), Glossu (Dave Bautista), Duncan (Jason Momoa) and I could go on. During it's 155 minute runtime however, not everyone gets enough characterization. I'd like to see certain characters explored more. Maybe in the sequel.After all DUNE is still a beautiful sci-fi movie. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's still a great piece of modern filmmaking.",positive
20,"Perhaps the greatest lesson that can be drawn from Denis Villeneuve's Dune is that ultimately an entirely satisfying adaptation of the novel is impossible. Nonetheless, Villeneuve's version is the closest at succeeding so far, and is one of the more enjoyable theatrical experiences of 2021.Villeneuve stays very adherent to the original work, even in the smaller elements. There are a few omissions however, and the first scenes are not present in the novel.His version has however not rendered from the sense of mistery that permeates the beginning of the novel. It immediately submerges its reader in the world of Dune, without any introduction, and the complex situation is slowly unraveled throughout the narrative. Villeneuve's previous films prove that this approach could have been undertaken by him, but the 2021 film chose instead to rely on several expository scenes that explain too much to the audience. Some of the revelations that are hinted at very early were not as clear until the second half of the novel (yet to be adapted). A choice dictated by the destination to a wider target audience, for sure, but that ultimately adds dryness to the film.Another slight disappointment might come from the score by Hans Zimmer. It does render the majestic epic scale of the film, but it perhaps remains overly somber and ambiental in scenes where it could have charged up the depicted tense situation.What works best in Dune is the flawless casting. Whoever has read the novel could hardly imagine different actors to portray the characters. Dune also succeeds in rendering the alien scape of the desertic planet Arrakis, as well as the other planets that are even only hinted in the novel, without reduntantly using the strong saturated colours of Lynch's version. Greig Fraser's cinematography is truly a feast for the eyes, aided by a desaturated yet captivating coloring. Rest assured: the sky is never blue, which is something that the latest promotional poster seemed to suggest. On the other hand, what the film does borrow from the never made Jodorowsky version is some of the production design elements, especially for the Harkonnens.Ultimately, even if Villeneuve did not make the perfect Dune film (and it is fairly possible to say at this point that such a film cannot exist), it is an entertaining film. It is entertaining and
keeps the viewer glued to the screen even despite its slow nature, leaves the viewer wanting for more, and that alone makes up for all the small imperfections it features.(Extracts from my longer review on my blog, comeandreview)",positive
21,"Watching director Denis Villeneuve's groundbreaking adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic science fiction novel ""Dune"" is like feasting on an all-you-can-eat buffet. You can gorge yourself on combatants and conspiracies galore during its spartan 156-minute runtime. Unlike its ill-fated predecessor, David Lynch's critically reviled ""Dune"" (1984), which shoehorned Herbert's gargantuan magnum opus into a procrustean 136-minute escapade, Villeneuve has the good sense not to pile everything into one film. Instead, this $165 million reboot delivers only half of the chronicle, while we must bide our time until the sequel. Some sci-fi fans may cringe at this prospect, but Warner Brothers refused to bank roll the sequel before ""Dune"" generated some box office traction. Mind you, sitting for two-hours and thirty-six minutes requires not only purpose but also patience. Meantime, Villeneuve retreads several Lynch scenes, but does it with greater scope and spontaneity. You cannot help but be caught up by the rollercoaster blend of white-knuckled cliffhanger heroics and Byzantine political intrigue. Although classified as science fiction, ""Dune"" never degenerates into a juvenile ""Buck Rogers"" space opera. ""Star Wars: Rogue One"" lenser Greg Fraser depicts these larger-than-life characters against surreal landscapes in sprawling picturesque murals. Surrounding Timothée Chalamet, who toplines as the hero, is a formidable cast consisting of Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson, Jason Momoa, Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, and Stellan Skarsgard. Overall, ""Dune"" raises the standards for sci-fi blockbusters. Nevertheless, the filmmakers don't bewilder the audience with narrative overload. Clearly, Villeneuve has surpassed his earlier outing ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017), and one can only wish him greater success with this sequel.Imagine a mash-up of ""Star Wars"" and ""Game of Thrones,"" and you'll have a clue about what ensues. Specifically, ""Dune"" takes place in the year 10,191. This tour de force saga of clashing empires unfolds on the bleak desert planet of Arrakis. This savage, sun-scorched world is the only source in the universe for a unique mineral called spice. Not only does interstellar space travel hinge on spice, but it also is a psychedelic drug that heightens awareness and lengthens life. The evil Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsgård of ""Good Will Hunting"") of the House of Harkonnen, who amounts to a smaller version of Jabba the Hutt, has reaped an obscene fortune in spice from Arrakis over the last 80 years. Now, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV removes the Baron and replaces him with a rival, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac of ""Ex-Machina"") of the mighty House of Atreides, who hails from the ocean planet of Caladan. Accompanied by his consort Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson of ""Doctor Sleep"") and their teenage son, Paul (Timothée Chalamet of ""Lady Bird""), the Duke arrives on Arrakis with his aide, Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin of ""Sicario""), and a vast army. Leto suspects the corrupt Emperor may be setting him up for failure.Pandemonium erupts soon after Leto has taken over the spice mining operation. Earlier, the Duke had vowed to forge an alliance with the natives. Known as the Fremen, this disgruntled nomadic race resides in Arrakis's deep caverns and conducts campaigns like guerrilla warriors against the spice miners. Suffering dreadfully under the Baron, the Fremen expect similar treatment from Leto. The Duke dispatches a scout, Duncan Idaho (Jason Momoa of ""Aquaman""), to embed himself among them and win their hearts and minds. Swathed in hooded white cloaks, this mahogany-skinned tribe has dazzling cobalt blue eyes from using spice. A blue-eyed babe haunts Paul's dreams. Meantime, the mining equipment Leto inherited from the Baron is in rough shape. If the broiling temps on the surface weren't bad enough, prodigious sandworms--some as long as 13-hundred feet--cruise beneath the shifting sands like great white sharks. These leviathans can wrap their elastic mouths, bristling with zillions of wicked, razor-sharp fangs, around an entire spice harvesting machine. Eventually, treachery within Leto's palace topples his rule, and the Baron's soldiers annihilate Atreides' army. Miraculously managing to escape, young Paul takes refuge with the Fremen and ponders a rebellion against the Baron.Comparisons between ""Dune"" and ""Star Wars"" are inevitable. Indeed, both films share certain formulaic scenes which seem virtually interchangeable. An empire-building yarn with anti-colonial sentiments, ""Dune"" takes itself far more seriously than ""Star Wars."" When Paul watches his mentor perish, our hero suffers as tragically as Luke when he witnessed the demise of Obi-wan Kenobi. ""Dune"" differs, too, because it is a sword and sandal saga about supernatural critters. Arrakis makes Tatooine seem like a beach resort. Villeneuve and ""Prometheus"" writer Jon Spaihts and ""A Star Is Born"" scripter Eric Roth don't overwhelm the audience with volumes of exposition that cluttered up the Lynch film. Instead, they parcel out exposition and use it to foreshadow events. The warfare is conducted with ancient as well as futuristic weapons, with emphasis on ancient weapons. The dragonfly helicopters-known as ornithopters-look exciting. The crisp dialogue is both pointed and compelling. Villeneuve and company never cut our underdog heroes any slack in this initial bloodthirsty chapter, and the evil Baron maintains the upper hand despite minor setbacks like a near-death experience. As villains go, the grotesquely fat Baron makes an admirable but unscrupulous adversary. Josh Brolin and Jason Momoa wield their weapons like old hands. Unlike Lynch, Villeneuve doesn't rub our noses in unsavory violence. Nonetheless, the battles are savage without being sadistic. Hans Zimmer's brawling orchestral score with native choral interludes enhances the atmosphere. Altogether, ""Dune"" qualifies as the first truly great science fiction classic of the 21st century with a coming-of-age hero driven by prophetic dreams he cannot fathom.",positive
22,"About an hour of back story that really made no sense. The Atreades are on their own planet, so they take about a thousand troops to the spice planet to mine for spice, at the request of the Emperor. When the colony is attacked, that is the end of the Atreades? What happened to their home planet?A lot of the back-story did not make sense. Even worse, the pace of this movie was incredibly slow and boring. The story of the Fremen is not explained. Why are the Harkkunen evil? That is not explained. The Harkkunen have been making gigantic amounts of money from their monopoly on the spice planet, so why are they bitter?I had a lot of questions. The dialogue was not very helpful. The Mother and Grandmother have special powers, why? Nothing is explained about their sect, or why French lead actor, Chalamet, might be ""The One.""There is not much action until the last 40 minutes or so. The fact that the family doctor can turn off the alarm system and shields to the entire colony was incredibly lame. That nobody was awake to know they were being attacked was even more lame. That King Atreades had absolutley no security staff, and got his ass kicked by the skinny doctor was pathetic.James Brolin is the top fighter for the Atreades clan, and he does almost nothing in this movie. Jason Momoa is the other top warrior and he is marginal. Both of these actors are wasted in this movie. They basically do nothing except to encourage the French kid with standard cliches.Zendaya shows up in the same visions that are repeated numerous times in the movie. There is a constant mix of the Chalamet kid's visions with the actual reality, and that is confusing.",negative
23,"Dune is an experience made for cinema. Do yourself a favor, spend your money and don't wait for it to appear on streaming. The Visuals, music, and sheer epicness are overwhelming. These alone are worth your watch.But that's not all. Characters, actors, set pieces, plot, and the whole production value is also top-notch.I haven't read the books so I don't know if the film stays true to the source material. But other reviews hint that this is the case. So even Fans will get their desired dose.To put it short: dune is a modern masterpiece and a Must have for any sci fi fan.",positive
24,"What can I say. Not only did I watch this movie, but my body was astrally projected to Arrakis.I got goosebumps whenever Hans Zimmer's melody pulsed through every sequence in this movie. I was surprised by the scale of the film's production. I went into trance together with Paul Atreides when he discovered that the tragic fate he envisioned was coming true.This movie only partially loses because it's half of a whole. I want to see more but I can't.Boring! For those with terrible taste, I have no doubts about that.As for the criticism of the white savior, read the damn books. Or just pay attention to what you're watching.Midway through the film, Paul has a vision of the future, in which the dangers of charismatic leadership elevated to godhood are thrown in the viewer's face. You have to be really mindless not to notice.This is one of the most epic sci-fi movies of all time. Watch it on the biggest screen you can.",negative
